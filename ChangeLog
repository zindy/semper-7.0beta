July 24:        Initial autoconf/automake functional
July 25:        Alpha version working in gcc/g77 & icc/ifort
        Open:   FSEEK intrinsic differs gcc & ifort
                SGI locals disabled (check for library?)
                fortran-C communication hacked, not right
                make dist, make rpm not functional
                unix command crashes second time around
                hrems has a different sized ctf !!!
                pput disabled
July 26:        Patched gfortran with externals range, unpack
                WOSLocals/hrems.f may be bad
                Is gfortran stable ?
                Patched c-code for portability (hopefully)
                make dist repaired
                Got framework for Mozilla help established
July 27:        Got the patching right, at least for HP
                Now both gcc & cc seem to work on HP
                At the same time, verified bigendian is correct
                Changed "Merge" WOS local to Merges to avoid intrinsic conflict
                Added KBUFP=max(1,KBUFP) to readln.f, kline.f to avoid segmentation violations
                Removed bound checks from debug compilation since equivalences kill it
                Included macro code to find various intrinsics
                Cambridge group found reallocate problem -- remove the macro?
                Patch directory added
July 28:        Solved tiff issues with I2 -- broken badly in I4
                Added parameters; must remove time (unstable)
                fort77 nearly works, but
                        a) Does not find lnblnk.c
                        b) Needs getcwd, access
                        c) Has to define some larger values
                           -Nn1604 -Nx400 -Df2c_i2
August 2nd:	Patched fort77 -- working version now included
		fort77 works with cygwin, need to hack -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib in
		Identified problem with nacoma 64 bit confusing autoconf macro -- with-CPU=??
		Patched LSEEk
		Version in header
August 3rd	Put PAUSE in at end of semini/helpman for catastrophic errors
		Moved split uixrea, uixsav and WOSLocals patches, hrems1, hrems2 probably broke
		TIFF not working with fort77 in cygwin -- char(0) ?
August 11th     A lot of things repaired
                Beta ready. Needs documentation.
Sept 1st        It's become apparent that g++ needs to be installed for input/output tiff to work
Sept 13-14      Many small changes in intrinsics for gfortran compatibility
                Small bug in LinkHelp.f repaired

Still to do:    Why does pput not work
                Create "make cygwin_dist"
		Test -with-CPU= for nacoma, pentium_m etc
		Do something about moving discs between big/little endian
		What is broke?
                Have fun

2012            Found integer image bug. Seems to be more than one thing. Finally solved, I think
