Things to do
============

dm2
---
Last left ic in middle of doing dm2 writes. Some parts not finished eg
packed complex?
rgb
Maybe 1D doesn't work some cases for these?

packed complex if:
   ffou = .true.
   origx = 1 and forigx = .true.
   ptype = 'c'

Reading in packed complex
   pbyte = 2*bytes/pixel

See notes on packed complex in red file 20

Also in middle of writing survey routines (in bits.f) needed so sensible
min and max values can be set for dm2 writes. (Now done)

Also for dm2:
Title (notes)
Orig x and y (possibly not possible)
date and time
Display min and max (as otherwise both default to 0). (Now done)

Time
----
Currently a bit of a mess. Often cannot get time from time string.


Problems
--------

Binary image -> int 1 uns
Packed complex -> complex 8
Normal FFT OK (can DM distinguish?)
RGB doesn't work
Does DM distinguish image and FFT?
No title
Display min and max not set (copy from dm3) (Difficult to get from dm3, survey instead)
"can't find "series/Co on Si CP.259"" error after reading 128 or so images (OK now)

dm3 reading
-----------

Images in "AA doesn't work with ic" (diag....dm3)
Both the preview and the main image are DataType 23 which is currently read as uns i4.
But the image is an rgb image imported as tiff (I seem to remember).
For a greyscale image each point contains the same byte repeated 3 times, suggesting
the format is 0rgb.
Now OK - just set DataType 23 to be rgb not uns i4 in dm3.f
Images now in ictests/dm3

Info on which is the preview image may be in the stuff at the beginning of the file.
There is a block of info about each image "AnnotationGroupList" which may say something
about which is a preview...
It is in:
Thumbnails/ImageIndex
The number is the index number of the preview image (first=0)

7 Dec 2005 - Making it work on linux
------------------------------------
Have converted bits.f, misc.f, syscalls.f, ic.f
Done gdm from dm2.f (except for the 'any other image' bit, which includes
most images

dm3.f: have got up to c$$$$$$$ in gdm3, mostly little change.

14 Dec 2005
Version that works mostly on linux. Now copied back to the mac to test

6 Feb 2006
----------
dm3 to dm2, images that don't work (ictests/dm3)
d3macFFT1dpac.dm3
d3pfft4.dm3
d3pfft8.dm3
t1fftpc.dm3

April 2007
----------
Modifications to s6dsk.f to read, write and dump semper discs larger than
1GB. Also checked it works on Mac Intel.
