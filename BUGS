There is a very good change that the WOS local hrems is broken.

Assigning a file using the APPEND option is probably broken. FSEEK needs to be 
repaired (usage of the intrinsic varies with compiler).

make rpm does not work

The unix command is somewhat broken (50% chance of working). This might be due 
to vfork.h problems, unclear

The NU Mozilla-Help structure is currently broken under cygwin

I/O for bmp and raster probably not working

To date, compilation working on:
        Cygwin
        HPUX
        Suse, Redhat (32 bit)
        SGI

To date, compilation has failed on:
        64bit Intel Nacoma: possibly in c code/headers
        Mac OS:             probably due to broken g77/gcc on Mac
