Consolidated bug list Feb 1999
==============================

NOISE notes
-----------
NOI UNI to two successive pics gives noise with quite extraordinary overlap,
with a few points where |XCF|~.3, and substantial portions visibly the same!
While no such problem without UNI, even default (gaussian) noise gives PS
with a few points near RHS of half-plane ~25 higher than the rest!


Status unknown
--------------
dis 70001 responds "?90: Device  4 is not a picture storage device@; why 4?
Does FITCTF work correctly for all 4 combinations of PHY, IPS? Should it?
Does it say underfocus/overfocus correctly while fitting?
Could it dump the results safely to a plist itself?

Active bugs
-----------
TURN OVER with odd number of rows doesn't write last row, but doesn't fault.
  [18.10.02]
SHOW DEV reports pic disc sizes correctly, but reports prog lib and help
  lib sizes in kB as MB - doubtless local bug introduced in DMANU changes.
On olympus, semper reports 'Unable to create default disc cache' at start
  of session, and indeed CACHE SHOW confirms size zero; but it seems to
  work quite fast in any case (at least for local discs)...
FT1D source line 11 should read 2*N at the end, not N/2
LIST DEV 5 NAME 'TEMP' fails - hanging with incomplete output; OK if
  to terminal; hangs also on standard lib device, and old 4-sight Semper;
  work-round via ASS FILE NAME 'TEMP'; ECHO CONS DEV N; LIST ALL; DEASS DEV N
DIS <his> is largely undocumented, but seems buggy; in particular
 - ignores PRE, taking range from histog and resetting MIN,MAX
EXA BRIEF prints Space occupied line as well as header line.
xcf -25 to 301 gives silly err msg "Device 5 is not a pic storage dev' (cd=6)
Real problems over terminal window background colour...
olympus hung on attempted ASS NEW SIZE 1000000 (ie 1GB); did create file OK;
  perhaps connected with SHOW/DMANU bug?  Does it work now?
FIR help file: claims wrongly that "each point of source is replaced not
  by kernel but by kernel rotated 180 deg".  In fact, FIR is equiv to
  direct convolution, and each point of source is indeed replaced by
  kernel.  [Change doc to fix]
Local LIB SIM should not use MAGIC as var: OVERLAY has option MAGENTA
3-fA: IITGEN still does not include this at all (though CTF now does with
  IPS=2 as well as IPS=1)
EMFIT help file gives example EMFIT PHYSICAL - but option does not exist;
  just delete the option
HELP SCALE.S claims MIN,MAX not reset to output pic range if PRESET; but
  they are nevertheless reset (to 0,255) by SCA BYTE PRE. [Just fix doc]
PDRAW 13 PIC DIS treats 13 as image to be modified; but PDRAW 13 treats 13
  as display!  [Real problem is use of two assumed keys with no stated
  relative priority]
SG specific? OVERLAY RED (or other colour) only works if used BEFORE any
  output; subsequent use cause overlay to disappear permanently.  [Present
  in 4-sight and X-windows versions however...][HELP OVER.C gives lots
  of info, describing 8 overlays, and OVER SHOW; but little of it appears
  to work...]
OVER OFF appears to WIPE overlay; OVER ON restores workable but blank overlay
LATTICE: if DIS=1002, LAT MARK FS:4 actually marks 1002 (and leaves DIS
  set to 1002). Oh dear..
HELP SURVEY does not say subregions ignored when surveying histograms.
Following DIS <subregion>, MARK SIZE.. takes TOP/BOT/LEF/RIG relative to
  edges of displayed subregion, not original picture; MARK POS gets it
  right, so there is a nasty inconsistency.
XCF does not complain about complex sources, and correlates the real parts
  but gets the normalisation wrong.

Prog/Runfile ghastly.  The following line, in a program OR a run file,
    for n=1,6; x#n=0; loop
  is faulted (?3 Bad value for n) if n=1234 when LIB or RUN cmd is typed;
  something is encoding current n in the line before executing the for.
  This makes RUN cmds unpredictable - catastrophe; for the LIB case, an
  error msg is produced BUT execution (of the ADD continues), so you can
  easily miss the error msg and get an incomplete program loaded...
Prog/Runfile decoding.  The following perfectly legal RUN file
    ! Matched region coordinates: all pre-registered
    for n=1,6; x#n=0 y#n=0; loop
    end
  fails (?106 FOR with no matching LOOP) unless
  EITHER spaces are inserted at the start of each line (as here!),
  OR the colon is removed from the comment,
  OR a semicolon is inserted before y#n!!
RUNfile ghastly: the following
    for n=n1,n2; calc mod(n:n) to out; out=out+1; loop
  is faulted (?106 FOR with no matching LOOP) unless you split the line
  so that loop is on the next line; but it's OK with mod(:n) rather than
  mod(n:n)!!
Another infelicity... old, WOS's fault, but with no better than a very messy
  work round.  Suppose CD=2, and you run a lib prog reading
    ASK 'Pic ' N
    CALC :N...;
  If you enter 1, this operates on 2:1 correctly; but if you enter 7:1 it
  operates on 2:1 instead.  CALC N:N operates on 7:1 correctly in the second
  case, but on 1:1 in the first!  The only safe course appears to be for the
  prog to expand all pic nums to include the devnum explicitly, and refer to
  N:N explicitly in CALC cmds.

Fixed / to be ignored [listed so that we can confirm them fixed]
---------------------
Some time while DP fitting, I found FS reset to 5 - the var is fixed but
  not protected.  I couldn't find any reference in *.f or *.spl...
Even new CTF has option VERIFY defined in SEMPER.SYN!  Definitely not in
  current code at least - fixed
CTF assumes PHY if IPS=2 and protests if KV,CS not set - fixed
LIB EM should ask for IPS unconditionally; it's difficult to change from
  LIB SIM otherwise - fixed
LIB EM with IPS=2 says UNDERfocus when asking for C1 - fixed
PEAKS: with SRA set, can call , PEAKS2 with zero for adj arr dim.
   [Fixed long ago]
GAU: help and docn claim different profile from code; amend code line
  to read A=-.5/RAD/RAD rather than A=-1./RAD/RAD [Fixed]
HELP BASE claims display marking lines are from actual posns in dir'n
   of corresponding fitted lattice site; in fact they are in opposite dir'n,
   from actual posn but in dirn of local displ't.  [Fixed]
BASE: does divn overflow if U=V=0 instead of trapping tidily [Fixed]
HELP BASE.SYN claims no default for TOLERANCE, whereas 0.3 is provided [Fixed]
1-nov-90: HELP EXT does not list opts NNEI, BICUBIC [Fixed]
1-nov-90: CALC RE() produces IM() [Fixed]
BASE reports wrong rms devn [Fixed]
CREATE crashes if SELECT does not exist [Fixed]
HELP CTF and SYNTAX CTF list option VERIFY which no longer exists
  [Fixed in (very different) local version]
ADD: recognises the line 'TYPE (1-2)*3' as a program entry point; ditto
  'UNLESS (condition)' etc. [Fixed]
REINIT: happily reinitialises a program library with a picture if told
  to do so [Fixed]
SHOW DEV, DIR (etc?) use f8.2 for size in kB and can't take 1GB [Fixed
  locally in /sloc/show.f,dmanu.f]

SEP 02 INSERTION - another file BUGS.LIS plus a few lines from elsewhere
----------------
6.4 (I believe - it's the old .EXE following reinstallation of 6.4 from disc)
===
disc caching in a dangerous state: not apparently flushing cleanly when a
  device is deassigned?  Thus ASS NAM 'ONE'; DIR DEV N; DEASS; ASS NAM 'TWO';
  DIR DEV N produces same output twice; EXA ALL produces lots of malformed
  label messages.. and I got some hangs as if bad numerical opns not trapped !!

PIC cmd faults macros rather than reporting class via C; needs name added to
  list in SEMOPN of cmds allowed to open macros
HELP PIC says Hist is class 8, Plist class 9, whereas they are actually the
  other way round; confirmed present in Imagine System v6.4 Nov 94...
HELP PIC should also now refer to PIC rather than PCB.
POST applied to pictures (not display) inserts line ' Warning: ...' followed
  by pic title or number as line 2 of .ps file, which is then illegal!
PLEASE add option MANUAL to POSTSCRIPT as in Vax versn

KLC code
- TSD sets SD to var(), not sd()

No idea of real date, force..
---------------------------
hrems.shl needs mandel, apo, merge, dpsmg, dpzero, polyf...
lots more libprogs.shl...
APHi in testpars better not on pi/4 exactly
emfit phy requires CS, but does not complain about its absence (just takes
  default of 1)
  - assumes PHY... should have option removed
SHRIEK! with n=992, dpx.spl will not add, protesting that tx#n has
  a bad value for n... so the name processing is not being skipped
  cleanly... REAL SEMPER NASTY - whose fault?

RESUMING MAIN OLIST





Infelicities...
------------
BASE should suppress ALL printout for NOVER; at present you can't make
  it shut up about % peaks outside fitting tolerance and # posns retained
PCB (old) sets FORM which messes up WAIT.  Anything else?
CTF: IPS=1 takes 3-f azimuth to be that of max OVERfocus,
  producing same phase shifts as with IPS=2, but inconsistent with 2-fA
  for which azimuth is that of max UNDERfocus.  Easily fixed in CTF2 (and
  LIB EM), but it's not worth bothering.
DIS <histogram> offers no means of controlling EITHER horiz or vert scale

Desirable enhancements (never now likely to happen)
---------------------------------------------------
CUT: a TRUNC option would make CUT SIZE 128 work on 129,256 half-plane xform.
SURVEY FULL could usefully set SKEW (if histogram at least)
DISPLAY could very usefully letter 1-d graphs!
FIT polynomial (like POLYF) as well as linear function
Mark mean,sd on displayed histograms
REINIT could usefully check for wp pics before wiping device!
LMIN, LMAX would be useful
Better ROTATE using column mode display access
Can DIS TIMES <large> really not set TIMES for itself?
XWI GRAPH could usefully retain the display form,class
Picture discs should include LNBLK,CBSIZE in header block so that
   all the info necessary for decoding is available
Better 1-D display lettering
