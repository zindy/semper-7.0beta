A woefully short file at the moment!

1) Put the location of semper7 in your PATH variable, e.g.
PATH=/usr/local/semper-7.0beta/bin:$PATH
export PATH

2) Copy the contents of /usr/local/semper-7.0beta/Examples (change 
as needed if you used a different location). This will allow you to
start. Before you do, you probably want to create a help library
using helpman7 -- which has fairly self explanatory commands.

3) Run semper. The command help XYZ will provide some information
which you may have to wade through. In some cases doing help /mon XYZ
may be better (but rather lengthy).
